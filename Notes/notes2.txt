SYN flood: form of DoS attack
  -succession of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough server resources
  -when legitimate user tries to connect, server refuses resulting in DoS
  -normal process: SYN (client) -> SYN-ACK (server) -> SYN (client) TCP three way-handshake
  -can disrupt process by:
    1. Choosing not to send back expected ACK
    2. Spoofing the source IP address in the SYN
  -countermeasures:
    1. Filtering
    2. Increasing backlog
    3. Reducing SYN-RECEIVED Timer
    4. Recycling the oldest half-open TCP
    5. SYN cache
    6. SYN cookies
    7. Hybrid approaches

SYN cookies: system of particular choices of initial TCP sequence numbers by TCP servers
  -top 5 bits: t mod 32, where t is a 32 bit time counter that increases every 64 seconds
  -next 3 bits: encoding of MSS selected by server in response to client MSS
  -bottom 24 bits: server selected secret function of client IP and port numbers

TCPDUMP: dump traffic on a network
  -tcpdump -? [ -B buffer_size ], ? can include:
    [ -c count ] [ -C file_size ]
    [ -F file ] [ -G rotate_seconds ] [ -i interface ]
    [ --immediate-mode ] [ -j tstamp_type ] [ -m module ]
    [ -M secret ] [ --number ] [ --print ] [ -Q in|out|inout ]
    [ -r file ] [ -s snaplen ] [ -T type ] [ --version ]
    [ -V file ] [ -w file ] [ -W filecount ] [ -y datalinktype ]
    [ -z postrotate-command ] [ -Z user ]
  -prints out a description of the contents of packets on a network interface that match boolean expression
